                    I am currently the Head of Digitalization and Corporate Communication Secretariat in the College 
                    Representative Council of Sri Rajang College, Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Campus. I manage all 
                    incoming photos from college-organized programs for documentation and publication on the college and 
                    university’s social media pages, and sometimes in newspapers. A notable program I photographed was 
                    UPM’s 48th Convocation, Session 1. Alongside that, I have documented many events within the college, 
                    university, and community programs such as longhouse visits.

                    images were shared.

                    In 2021, during the lockdowns, a friend and I created a special Teacher’s Day video to show appreciation 
                    for our teachers who had been teaching us virtually. The video featured students turning on their cameras 
                    and sharing words of encouragement—something that made this moment unique to that year.

                    From time to time, I engage in graphic design—mainly focusing on creating posters, slides, and other visual materials for events. Whether it’s a promotional poster or an informative slide deck, I aim to design visuals that are both aesthetically appealing and effective in delivering key messages. My slides serve as engaging backdrops during presentations, helping to enhance storytelling and ensure that audiences receive information in a clear, structured, and visually compelling manner.

                    One of my most significant projects was designing my school’s yearbook. This involved compiling and curating a collection of photos, essays, and memories that captured the essence of our batch’s journey. In addition to the standard class and event pages, I incorporated special sections featuring heartfelt messages, student reflections, and a nostalgic look back at previous years. The final product spanned over 100 pages and was carefully designed to balance visual appeal with meaningful content. It was made available both in print and as a free digital copy, ensuring that every batchmate had access to this keepsake.

Whether it’s branding an event or crafting digital content, I enjoy the challenge of translating concepts into designs that leave a lasting impact.

                    I specialize in technical event work, handling the setup and management of sound systems, microphones, projectors, and lighting. Whether it’s a small presentation or a large-scale performance, I ensure that all audiovisual elements run smoothly. During high-stakes events, I take charge of the control room, coordinating live audio and visuals to create a seamless experience for both performers and audiences. I enjoy troubleshooting technical issues on the fly and making quick adjustments to maintain the flow of an event.

                    One of my most challenging projects was a primary school mini-musical, where I managed 10 microphones, including four head mics. This required careful audio balancing, muting mics when students were offstage, and ensuring clear sound for every performer. I meticulously planned the wiring, labeled each connection, and created a system to prevent technical failures. In addition to audio, I also handle stage lighting design, programming 20 programmable LED lights in my school hall to enhance stage presence and set the right atmosphere for different performances.

                    Currently, I am expanding my expertise by exploring digital mixers and live video streaming at my university. Learning advanced audio processing and real-time broadcasting allows me to stay updated with modern event production techniques. My goal is to refine my technical skills and apply them to increasingly complex events, ensuring every production runs at a professional standard.
